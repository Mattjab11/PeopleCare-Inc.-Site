                <h3>Keep PeopleCare in the Wings</h3>
                <p>Evelyn (81) called PeopleCare to inquire about taking her husband, Tony, to MacNeal Hospital for cancer treatments in the event he was not able to drive himself. He had recently been diagnosed with lymphoma. Ange assured her we could help out and spent most of that first phone call just listening. Evelyn was distraught about her husband, even as her own health deteriorated. They have one daughter, in Northern Wisconsin, she must work, so they had no help close at hand.</p>
                <p>She began calling PeopleCare just to talk and tell us about Tony's condition. Ange gave Evelyn her home phone number because she was afraid what they might do if they couldn't find a ride on the weekend. The phone became Evelyn's security blanket…she would call 2 or 3 times per week. In November Tony changed doctors and began going to Northwestern. He continued to drive himself for treatments until he eventually became too weak, at which time, Northwestern sent a hospital courtesy car to pick him up for treatments and doctor visits, as well as frequent hospitalizations.</p>
                <p>Evelyn called just to talk and "to keep PeopleCare in the wings in case she needed us." Ange referred her to SW Suburban Center on Aging to help answer questions about nursing homes and home healthcare. Evelyn became very upset because she couldn't afford any help.</p>
                <p>It was the end of February and Tony's doctors finally hospitalized him and told Evelyn it probably wouldn't be long before Tony could no longer fight the fight. Their daughter came to stay with them for 4-5 days…but Tony lingered and their daughter had to return home.</p>
                <p>Evelyn was alone again and asked if Shepherds could drive her to Northwestern to see Tony. Although we don't normally do that, we bent the rules so she could see him before he died. We were lucky…Ken Mooney said yes and drove her one day. Harold Verdak, another Shepherds volunteer said he'd take her the following week. Believe it or not, Tony was sent home. Evelyn called Ange practically everyday even though a home health nurse came daily. Ange also continued giving her numbers to call…SW Suburban Council on Aging, Staying-At-Home and more.</p>
                <p>Now it's March and Tony is on his way back to the hospital, sent by the home nurse, because all his blood counts were so low. Evelyn never saw him again…Tony died two days later. A neighbor drove her to the hospital when Evelyn received the call. She said she felt better after she saw him, "because he was still warm."</p>
                <p>Ange told her we would stay in touch and that we could certainly help her with her own rides to Loyola. She calmed down some…cause Tony always took her.</p>
                <p>Evelyn called to say she received a very thoughtful sympathy card from PeopleCare.</p>

                <h3>Not Now Honey, I'm Playing Bingo</h3>
                <p>Trudy lived in The British Home and was pretty spunky for her 91 years. Her friend and PeopleCare volunteer, Carol would visit her from time to time to talk. Trudy always looked forward to the visits, as did Carol, who maintains she gained as much from the visits as Trudy did.</p>
                <p>This day was a special visit. It was Christmas morning and Carol had gone to midnight Mass the night before. She had a special feeling the warmth in her heart. One thing kept tugging at her though…Trudy…visit Trudy.</p>
                <p>So she did. She found Trudy in her room. When she realized Carol was there, she said, " I prayed that you would visit today. " Trudy was not doing well. They talked…reminisced…it was nice to have a friend. What a nice morning.</p>
                <p>The next time, just after the holidays Carol visited again. This time Trudy wasn't in her room. Concerned, Carol looked everywhere, finally finding her, wheelchair and all, in the lounge playing bingo.</p>
                <p>Relieved, Carol stopped in and said, "Hi Trudy, how are you doing?"</p>
                <p>Trudy bubbled, "Not now , Honey, I'm playing bingo!"</p>
                <p>After a laugh of disbelief, Carol sat and waited for a few minutes as the game finished. She and Trudy then talked for about an hour about her sudden energy. Trudy remarked that she was still waiting for the Polident Carol had promised to bring at Christmas. Trudy also couldn't remember her birthday, which Carol reminded her was May 13th, when she'd be 92.</p>
                <p>When Carol called Alice the next morning to check in…she got word that Trudy had died during the night. She had been able to see her friend for the last time. Carol still misses Trudy.</p>

                <h3>Sometimes the Rules Don't Count</h3>
                <p>Sometimes you never know where the help will be needed. A PeopleCare volunteer had been visiting Phyllis, an 80 year old with Alzheimers. One particular visit she seemed especially agitated and upset. When asked if there was anything wrong she indicated that her daughter, Ellen, 51, had been diagnosed with cancer and was having a very difficult time coping with her treatments. Ellen was growing weaker every day and could no longer drive or help her mother. Who would be able to help?</p>
                <p>Although the daughter was not over 65 we felt we could help because we were already helping her mother and helping one meant helping both. We were able to drive Mary Ann to her treatments and a member of our staff did a lot of listening and hand holding, in addition to working with Community Care Options, making both of them as comfortable as possible.</p>
                <p>Ellen died in May of that year and her mother died in the British Home in November of same year. One of our staff attended the visitations and services.</p>

                <h3>True Story</h3>
                <p><span class="story-initial">E</span>lla from Brookfield was 96 and her family was finding it difficult to get her to daily cancer therapy at Loyola. Making it more difficult: the rides that would be required for six weeks, five days a week. That's 60 rides to coordinate. PeopleCare volunteers to the rescue. Every ride in July and August was scheduled and the team went to work. Jack and Marilyn worked in tandem on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Eileen took Wednesdays. Janet Mondays. Doris, Ann and Ernie filled in wherever they were needed. Ella got to therapy…with a big cheering section.</p>

                <h3>One Call</h3>
                <p>What can one hour mean? To a PeopleCare client it can mean a doctor's appointment on time, a filled prescription, or three hotels on boardwalk. To a PeopleCare volunteer it's seeing the amazing difference their time can make. Every hour is precious. At PeopleCare we think that's the most important lesson of all.</p>
