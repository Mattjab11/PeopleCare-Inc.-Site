            "No older person in the last third of life will feel abandoned and will be able to live out their life in the most productive way possible." – The PeopleCare Vision Statement
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Building a Legacy of Care</h2>
            <p>We all plan for the future. Often we set goals for ourselves, such as advancing our careers, running a marathon or visiting exotic places. However, the most important plans we make concern the welfare of others, particularly our families. We thoughtfully consider what the future may hold and take appropriate action to meet the needs of those who are important to us.</p>
            
            <p>As friends and neighbors, sometimes we are called upon to help those who cannot always help themselves in the same way. To help achieve the mission of helping older adults in our community, PeopleCare has established an endowment fund to provide a reliable source of income to the organization and its mission for generations to come.</p>
            
            <p>The Hats Off To Helen Endowment Fund (HOTH), named for our Founder Helen Jablonski, has a unique purpose in the life of our community—to empower the mission and sustain the operating budget of PeopleCare beyond what is possible through annual operating funds. The Endowment Fund is not simply a hedge against future uncertainties, but is a commitment to provide future generations of older adults assistance and support by providing socialization, emotional support and access to service providers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Older Adult Initiatives</h2>
            <p>The following values are affirmed as central to our work with older adults:</p>
            <ul class="values-list">
                <li>All individuals will be treated with integrity, sincerity and empathy</li>
                <li>All individuals' privacy, dignity, autonomy and diversity will be respected and honored</li>
                <li>PeopleCare and HOTH are charged with a commitment to direct service, team work, partnership and connection to the community especially to individuals and family members.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Currently PeopleCare offers the following services and initiatives throughout the communities of Brookfield, LaGrange, LaGrange Park, Lyons, North Riverside, Riverside, and Westchester:</p>
            <ul class="services-list">
                <li>Cooperative Group Grocery Shopping (in partnership with Cantata Adult Life Services)</li>
                <li>Friendly Home Visitation</li>
                <li>Information and Referral</li>
                <li>Volunteer Transportation</li>
                <li>Voucher Taxi Program (in partnership with Aging Care Connections)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>HOTH Endowment Goals</h2>
            <p>The number one goal of HOTH is to grow the Endowment to a level where the return on investment could empower and sustain the operating budget of PeopleCare, Inc. beyond yearly income from services and foundation grants.</p>
            
            <div class="goals-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>2 year goal of $500,000 by fiscal year end 2016</li>
                    <li>5 Year goal of $1,000,000 by fiscal year end 2019</li>
                    <li>10 year of $2,000,000 by fiscal year end 2024</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>At our current budgetary levels, a return on investment of 5% could sustain PeopleCare operations on yearly basis, indefinitely. It would also allow us to advance initiatives and support further into our surrounding communities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Gifts to the HOTH Endowment</h2>
            <p>Gifts to the HOTH Endowment for PeopleCare can be made in two ways: by a direct gift of cash or check, or by a planned gift. Planned Gifts, though requiring financial and estate planning assistance, offer a unique opportunity to make a substantial gift to the HOTH Endowment Fund while providing for one's family. Some planned gift options provide income for life and reduce the tax burden on the donors and their heirs.</p>
            
            <p>Please feel free to contact Bruce F. Jablonski, Executive Director, or any member of the Endowment Committee for additional information, or to discuss confidentially the best way to make a gift. We are grateful for your generosity and commitment to ensure the future of the PeopleCare mission.</p>
